# A visual representation for deliverables in a matrix
A deliverable is basically a set of tasks which are required to be finished/done in order to "deliver" the deliverable/thing. The naming is derived from the sablono project platform. Synonyms for deliverable are:
* document
* thing
* plan
* story
* feature
* product

We expect that a deliverable covers between 1 and 100 tasks/activities. Our product for example is used in construction site management where a deliverable process could be:
1. place order
2. offside construction
3. deliver element
4. check delivery
5. raise and assemble element
6. approve links
7. trigger payment

The view should look like this:
